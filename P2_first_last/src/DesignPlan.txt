Due: 3/12/2025 11:59pm

After reading the specs, start populating a list of things
you think you might have to do to finish this project


1). read the specs - understand the project
2). create the file with the path 
3). create a queue and stack for future implementation
4). create test cases
5). create a 2d array to store the maze
6) create 3 methods each for queue, stack, and optimal path based algorithms 
7). implement variables to check command-line arguments(stack, queue, time, opt, etc.); all booleans
8). implement variables to check for text based or coordinate based maps
9). check for illegal characters, incomplete maps, etc. listed in the guide (text-map), and 
illegal characters, invalid coords, etc. (coord-based map)
10). finish all 3 methods and test with test cases
11). write the User-Defined-Exceptions listed in the guide 
12). track run time by isolating the time it takes for the program to run
 (excluding reading inputs/outputs)
