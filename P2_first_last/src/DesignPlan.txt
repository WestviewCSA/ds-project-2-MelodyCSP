Due: 3/12/2025 11:59pm

After reading the specs, start populating a list of things
you think you might have to do to finish this project


1). read the specs - understand the project
2). create files with multiple paths 
3). create a queue and stack for future implementation
4). create a JUnit test case for future testing
5) create 3 methods each for queue, stack, and optimal path based algorithms 
6). create scanners in each method to scan the file
7). implement variables to check command-line arguments(stack, queue, time, opt, etc.); all booleans
8). implement variables to check for text based or coordinate based maps
9). implement code for queue
10). when queue is finished, use the code for stack and make few adjustments (since both are similar concepts)
11). implement code for optimal path algorithm 
12). go back and check for illegal characters, incomplete maps, etc. listed in the guide (text-map), and 
illegal characters, invalid coords, etc. (coord-based map)
13). finish all 3 methods and test with test cases
14). write the User-Defined-Exceptions listed in the guide 
15). track run time by isolating the time it takes for the program to run
 (excluding reading inputs/outputs)
